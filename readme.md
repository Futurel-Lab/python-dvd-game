# Python DVD Game
This is a simple "game" if you want to call it that, using a bouncing DVD project from [tczkqq](https://github.com/tczkqq/dvd-corner).
I added logic that checks if the DVD logo has hit any of the corners of the screen. If it has, a sound will be played (`sounds/cheer.mp3`) and a point will be added to the counter.

# Future Plans
No plans to add to or modify project at this time. Feel free to check it out or play around.
